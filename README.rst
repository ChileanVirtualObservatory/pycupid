PyCupid - Python wrappers for Starlink's CUPID package
======================================================

CUPID is part of the `Starlink Software Collection <http://www.starlink.ac.uk/>`,
it provides a set of commands that identify and analyse clumps of emission within 1-,
2- and 3-dimensional data arrays.

This module aims to serve as an interface between CUPID implementation (C and
Fortran) and Python. As such, users can simply import the module and use CUPID
functions as if they were implemented in Python.
